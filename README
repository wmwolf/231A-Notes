This is essentially just a LaTeX repository for notes I take in David Berenstein's class, PHYS 231A: General Relativity at UCSB. I'm able to LaTeX up notes on the fly, so I share them here on GitHub. If you would like to contribute (proofreading, better explanations, and FIGURES!), I encourage and welcome your help. Just fork off this repo and start sending in commits!
